# Synergy GT: a Graph Transformer for Predicting Gene Synergy in *C. elegans* Aging

This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for the model known as Synergy GT, which serves as a computational tool for the Levine Lab and its research on the genetics of aging in the roundworm *C. elegans*. Although individual gene perturbations associated with aging and longevity have been well-studied, understanding/solving aging requires treating it as a complex, emergent phenotype driven by nonlinear genetic interactions. Synergistic gene interactions offer a view into the complexity of aging, and by predicting/learning to identify synergy in the genetic interaction network with deep learning we can better understand how aging/longevity emerges. Synergy GT does this by combining knowledge of gene-aging associations and a network of mechanistic gene-gene interactions to learn features of known synergistic gene pairs that distinguish them from those that are not. With a design inspired by biology and modern LLMs, Synergy GT can predict synergistic interactions at a level considerably better than baseline. As a result, the model can be used to characterize the likelihood of synergy between any pair of genes, which could lead to the discovery of novel synergistic pairs and a better understanding of the genetic landscape of aging.
