# Synergy GT: a Graph Transformer for Predicting Gene Synergy in *C. elegans* Aging

This repository contains all code and data for the model Synergy GT, which predicts the likelihood that two *C. elegans* genes synergistically determine lifespan using the organism's genetic interaction network and lifespan data from double mutant experiments.
